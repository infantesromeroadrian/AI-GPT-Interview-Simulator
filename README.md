# ChatGPT Interview Simulator 🤖💼🎤

Welcome to the ChatGPT Interview Simulator, an interactive tool designed to simulate a job interview experience using OpenAI's powerful GPT-3.5 Turbo model. Get ready to test your interview skills or practice interviewing others with the help of cutting-edge AI technology!

## Features 🌟

- **Interactive Interviews**: Conduct interviews with an AI-powered candidate.
- **Real-time Evaluation**: Get instant feedback on interview responses with a red or green indicator based on the AI's evaluation.
- **Customizable Fields**: Tailor the interview experience by specifying the candidate's field of expertise.
- **Streamlit Integration**: A user-friendly web interface built with Streamlit for easy access and navigation.

## Getting Started 🚀

To get started with the ChatGPT Interview Simulator:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed, along with the `openai` and `streamlit` libraries.
3. Set up your OpenAI API key as an environment variable:
    ```
    export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'
    ```
4. Navigate to the `src` directory and run the Streamlit app:
    ```
    cd src
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
5. Open the local URL provided by Streamlit in your web browser and begin the interview process!

## How It Works 🧠

The simulator asks the interviewer to input the field of expertise for the candidate. Once provided, the interviewer can start the interview by entering questions for the AI candidate. The AI's responses are generated in real-time and evaluated against the interviewer's expectations. The interviewer can then input the real candidate's response for a side-by-side evaluation against the AI's response.

## Requirements 📋

- Python 3.x
- `openai` library
- `streamlit` library

## Installation 💽

To install the necessary libraries, run:

```shell
poetry install openai streamlit
```
